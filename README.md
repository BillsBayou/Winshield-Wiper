# Winshield-Wiper

An Arduino circuit modified from the Mood Cue circuit

This is a test to see if I could get a single speed servo to act as a variable speed servo.  I think it does a fair job of that.

Left potentiometer controls the mode: Off/Variable/Low/High  

Right potentiometer controls the speed while in Variable mode

Don't put the capacitors in backwards and everything should be okay.
